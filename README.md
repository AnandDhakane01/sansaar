# Sansaar

Everything backend about NavGurukul :)
This repository holds (will hold, as we are building it) the universe of NavGurukul.
All the APIs exist here.

Your contribution is more than welcomed ðŸ¤©
## Project set-up
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/navgurukul/sansaar.git`
- Install dependencies `npm install` and then chnage directory `cd sansaar`
- `npm install -g knex`
- Copy `server/sample.env` file to `server/.env` file and change the appropriate field.
- Run `knex migrate:latest` for updating migration file.
- If any error is throwing while running above script then login to the postgres server and remove all the rows of the the knex_migrations table using `TRUNCATE TABLE knex_migrations` and run `knex migrate:latest` again.
## Code Strucutre
- *The philosophy of the code strucutre is keeping things as small as they can be. Keeping functions small, components small, and files small. Basically keeping everything as small as they can be. Like Minions, We love Minions. Who doesn't .*

### The file structure looks something like this.

## To Dos
- [ ] How to show scope on Swagger?
- [ ] Add service generator in .hc.js
- [ ] Swagger API should work on prod

## course add and update

running it with `--addUpdateSingleCourse` will add or update single course returned by the server.

```bash
node lib/courseSeeder/index.js --addUpdateSingleCourse {course_name}
```

running below script will add or update all course returned by the server.

```bash
node lib/courseSeeder/index.js 
```

## Curriculum
1. ```git clone https://github.com/navgurukul/newton curriculum```
